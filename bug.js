While developing an Expo app, I encountered an unusual issue where the app would crash intermittently on Android devices. The crash wasn't consistently reproducible, making debugging challenging.  The error logs were unhelpful, providing only a generic `native module not found` message.  The issue only seemed to manifest on certain devices and under specific, seemingly random circumstances. I checked all dependencies, ensured correct configurations, cleaned the build, and tried different emulators, but the problem persisted.
