The solution may require a more comprehensive investigation into the project's dependencies and the interactions between the JavaScript and native module environments.  Check for any native modules that might have unmet dependencies.   Rebuilding the project entirely, making sure to clean the build folders completely and reinstall dependencies is crucial. Ensure your `package.json` is correctly defined, and your native module installations are consistent. Consider checking the Expo documentation for any known native module compatibility issues for the specific devices where the crashes occur. In some cases, downgrading specific packages might temporarily resolve the issue, allowing for a more targeted investigation.  If the issue persists, logging more detailed diagnostics and examining the native modules themselves is important for thorough debugging.
